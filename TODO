Clean up our code.
Improve total_score function a bit -> different scores depending on when folks were matched (for e.g. 5 for 1 week, 3 for 2 weeks and so on).
Script to check if irmin branch to remote branch, run the slack_bot and then push the new database.
Push irmin database to github - make a separate repo!
Schedule the script to run.
Deploy the slack bot with mirageOS.
Interaction with bot
     - skipping matches.
        - slackbot interface
        - store the information (of who is to be skipped) in the database.
    - skip talking to some people
Add Cmdliner so that the script can switch between test and real case.
Add `.opam` file so that installing slack_bot becomes easier.
Add logging instead of Printf statements.

Separating:
- Curl requests to slack module
- interacting with irmin 
- hashmap module -> constructing and reading from the hashmap. In the hashmap module, type t is hashmap, but subtype is pair (an alias type for a pair of strings, have an equality function for this type)
- matches module, randomizing matches, creating new matches etc etc
- driver module (connects all the modules together?)
