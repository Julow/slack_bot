# TODO

- new feature: write a private message to each matched couple/triple proposing a time for their chat
- use upstream `httpaf` (it's released now) instead of "vendoring" it into http_mirage_client.{ml,mli}
- improve `create.sh`. to start with, write it in OCaml
- have a look at the TODOs and FIXMEs in the code
- improve the logging and error messages and make them more coherent
