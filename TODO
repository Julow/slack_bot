# TODO

Clean up our code.
Schedule the script to run.
Deploy the slack bot with mirageOS.
Interaction with bot
     - skipping matches.
        - slackbot interface
        - store the information (of who is to be skipped) in the database.
    - skip talking to some people
Add Cmdliner so that the script can switch between test and real case.
Add `.opam` file so that installing slack_bot becomes easier.
Add logging instead of Printf statements.

## NEW TODO

- Rewrite irmin_unix to irmin git
- Have git interactions inside the code rather than a script
